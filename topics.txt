React Part 5: Understanding Hooks and State variables in React
##############################################################

Hooks
    - Reference: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#which-versions-of-react-include-hooks

    - Hooks are essentially JS functions which we use inside React components to do some tasks

    - All Hooks will have 'use' prefix behind them.

    - Example of Hooks are - useState, useContext, useEffect




State Variables
    - useState()  Hook is used to create state variables

        Ex: const [timer, setTimer] = useState(0);

    - We use state variables because their value is preserved even after 
        component re-rendering.



Important Points
################

Q. What is this concept of component re-rendering in React ?
A. React components are dynamic in nature. So based on input or changes new html content is 
    dynamically created. 

    This happens by calling the component function again and again, that calling of component
    function which returns the html code is only called as re-rendering of components in React.
